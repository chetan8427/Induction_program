His thoughts on “God and Math” were particularly captivating and stirred our curiosity about the deeper aspects of learning.

Following this, **Dr. Priya Darshani** conducted a session on **Universal Human Values**. She made us reflect on our personal priorities, human relationships, self-awareness, and the significance of compassion. Her words urged us to not just be good engineers, but responsible and kind human beings.
